you can use code from this site as long as i'm credited, and that the front end of your project does not look visually similar to this site, however you're not allowed to use the fonts included on this site, as Google Sans is copyright of Google/Alphabet, Font Awesome 5 is copyright of Fort Awesome.

### Notes for development:

The lazy-loading and SPA mechanisms require a server. Use something like `php -S 127.0.0.1:9867`, then open [this](http://127.0.0.1:9867) in a browser.
